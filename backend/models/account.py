backend/models/account.py

This module defines the Account model for BitcoinTXâ€”a Bitcoin-only portfolio
tracker and transaction management application.

Key Features:
  - Supports different account types via an enumeration (Bank, Wallet, Exchange).
  - Stores balances in both USD and BTC for flexibility.
  - Establishes relationships with the User and Transaction models.
  - Includes helper methods to update account balances.

Note:
  Although BitcoinTX is designed as a one-user application, the model allows
  that user to have multiple accounts (e.g., a bank account for fiat funds,
  a wallet for BTC, and an exchange account for trading). This design supports
  clear separation of funds and provides flexibility for future enhancements.

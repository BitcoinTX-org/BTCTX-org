backend/models/user.py

This module defines the User model for BitcoinTXâ€”a Bitcoin-only portfolio tracker
and transaction management application.

BitcoinTX is designed as a one-user application, so typically only a single user record
will exist. However, the model is built using standard practices to allow for future
extensions or changes if needed.

Key Features:
  - Stores a unique user ID, username, and a hashed password.
  - Uses passlib to securely hash and verify passwords.
  - Establishes a one-to-many relationship with the Account model (each user can have
    multiple accounts, such as a bank account, wallet, and exchange account).
  - Provides helper methods for setting and verifying passwords.

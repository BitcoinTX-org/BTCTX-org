Refactored for Double-Entry (Plan B):
  - Replaces the single 'account_id' field with 'from_account_id' and 'to_account_id'.
  - Minimally updates balances in the from/to accounts (if desired).
  - Preserves fee, cost_basis_usd, and locking placeholders.
  - Future expansions can handle detailed cost basis recalculations, short/long-term gains, etc.

    Key Differences in Double-Entry:
      - We no longer have 'account_id'; we have 'from_account_id' and 'to_account_id'.

      - cost_basis_usd remains relevant for external BTC deposits or trades.
      - fee is always in USD, so we adjust the from_account's USD if needed.
